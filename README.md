# Sudoku solution with linear programming

## Project in linear and integer optimization

A 10-15 page report should be written for the final project of the course,
describing in detail the problem you have undertaken, its feasibility or the
Its applications, describe in detail its modelling (definition of variables,
parameters, constraints, functions, etc.), a description of the solution, the code that
written and the output with the solution, commentary on the solution or solutions. Be sure to
"play" sufficiently with your model on problems of different sizes or with
changes in parameter values or alternative methods of solving the problem
and compare them. At the end, the literature that
used.
